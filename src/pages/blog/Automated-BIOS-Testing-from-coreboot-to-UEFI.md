# Automating BIOS Testing: From coreboot to UEFI

BIOS testing is a critical yet complex part of firmware development. Whether you're working with open-source solutions like coreboot or industry-standard UEFI firmware, manual BIOS testing quickly becomes unmanageable as the number of configurations and updates increases. Testing firmware manually does not scale efficientlyâ€”you can only test more firmware or hardware linearly by adding more people, making automation essential. Automating BIOS testing significantly improves efficiency, reliability, and product quality.

## The Complexity of BIOS Firmware Testing

Testing BIOS firmware manually involves numerous challenges:

- **Limited Scalability**: Manual testing can only scale linearly with the number of people, making it unsustainable for large projects.
- **Human Error and Inconsistency**: Manual testing introduces variability and potential for human error, complicating issue identification.
- **Time-Consuming Manual Processes**: Manual testing slows down development cycles and delays release timelines.

## Advantages of Automated BIOS Testing

Automating BIOS testing provides substantial benefits:

- **Speed and Scalability**: Run tests simultaneously across multiple hardware configurations, significantly accelerating the validation process.
- **Consistency and Accuracy**: Automation ensures repeatable and accurate results.
- **Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)**: Seamlessly integrate automated tests into existing workflows for rapid and reliable firmware releases.

## Coreboot Automation
- Quickly verify boot integrity, hardware initialization, and payload execution.
- Automate testing across various boards and chipsets supported by coreboot.
- Ensure security features, like verified boot and TPM integration, function correctly.

**Example:** To see FirmwareCI in action, check out our [public coreboot showcase](https://github.com/BlindspotSoftware/coreboot).

## FirmwareCI: Simplifying BIOS Automation

FirmwareCI provides a powerful platform tailored for automated BIOS testing:

- **Vendor-Agnostic Approach**: FirmwareCI works seamlessly with firmware binaries from all vendors. Its black-box testing approach, using the firmware binaries directly rather than being part of the compilation or development process, ensures compatibility with any firmware SDK from IBVs or open-source firmware solutions.
- **Easy Setup**: Define tests using straightforward YAML configurations.
- **Seamless Integration**: Connect directly with GitHub, GitLab, and other CI/CD platforms.
- **Real-Time Reporting**: Immediate feedback on firmware builds, making debugging faster and easier.
- **Automated Hardware Testing**: Support for automated device flashing and power cycling to fully automate the testing process.
